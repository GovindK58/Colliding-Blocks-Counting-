# CoolX: Visual Simulations in simplecpp

Added my solutions for some of the cool graphic problems from the book, _An Introduction to Programming through C++_ by Abhiram Ranade
These programs are written using simplecpp library of C++

### Colliding blocks Counting π
Estimated digits of πππ by counting the number of collisions in a visual simulation of the 2-block collision problem

### Hilbert's Space Filling Curve
designed a program to display Nth order Hilbert's Space filling curve

### Fibonacci Curve
designed a program to display Nth order Fibonacci curve

### Tree
A design of a real-life tree
